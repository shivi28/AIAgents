# AIAgents
A repository demonstrating different types of AI Agents for language model interactions, vector search, and document analysis.

## Overview
This repository contains examples of AI agents built using LlamaIndex and Hugging Face models, showing how to:
- Create simple LLM agents with Hugging Face models
- Build complex document retrieval and analysis systems
- Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) workflows

## Installation
Each project directory contains its own installation instructions and requirements.txt file:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIAgents.git
cd AIAgents
```

2. For each project, create and activate a virtual environment before installing its dependencies.
